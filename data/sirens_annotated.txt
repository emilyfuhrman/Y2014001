<span class='bronze _0'>Bronze</span> by <span class='gold _0'>gold</span>, miss Douce's head by miss Kennedy's head, over the
crossblind of the Ormond bar <span class='heard _0'>heard</span> the viceregal <span class='hoof _0'>hoof</span>s go by, <span class='ring _0'>ring</span>ing <span class='steel _0'>steel</span>.
--Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and EAU DE NIL.
--Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:
--<span class='look _0'>Look</span> at the fellow in the tall silk.
--Who? Where? <span class='gold _0'>gold</span> asked more eagerly.
--In the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the sun.
He's <span class='look _0'>look</span>ing. Mind till I <span class='sea _0'>see</span>.
She darted, <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span>, to the backmost corner, flattening her face
against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.
Her wet lips tittered:
--He's killed <span class='look _0'>look</span>ing back.
She laughed:
--<span class='O _0'>O</span> wept! Aren't <span class='men _0'>men</span> frightful idiots?
With <span class='sad _0'>sad</span>ness.
Miss Kennedy sauntered <span class='sad _0'>sad</span>ly from <span class='bright _0'>bright</span> light, twining a loose <span class='hair _0'>hair</span>
behind an</span> ear. Sauntering <span class='sad _0'>sad</span>ly, <span class='gold _0'>gold</span> no more, she twisted twined a <span class='hair _0'>hair</span>.
<span class='sad _0'>Sad</span>ly she twined in sauntering <span class='gold _0'>gold</span> <span class='hair _0'>hair</span> behind a curving ear.
--It's them has the fine times, <span class='sad _0'>sad</span>ly then she said.
A man.
<span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>who went by by Moulang's <span class='pipe _0'>pipe</span>s bearing in his breast the sweets
of sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful <span class='word _0'>word</span>s, by
Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.
The boots to them, them in the bar, them bar<span class='maid _0'>maid</span>s came. For them
unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And
--There's your teas, he said.
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an
upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.
--What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.
--Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.
--Your beau, is it?
A haughty <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> replied:
--I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
impertinent insolence.
--Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she
threatened as he had <span class='come _0'>come</span>.
<span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m.
On her flower frowning miss Douce said:
--Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself I'll
<span class='ring _0'>wring</span> his ear for him a yard <span class='long _0'>long</span>.
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.
--Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered
under their reef of counter, <span class='wait _0'>wait</span>ing on footstools, crates upturned, <span class='wait _1'>wait</span>ing
for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of <span class='black _0'>black</span> <span class='satin _0'>satin</span>, two
and nine a yard, <span class='wait _0'>wait</span>ing for their teas to draw, and two and seven.
Yes, <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> from a<span class='near _0'>near</span>, by <span class='gold _0'>gold</span> from a<span class='far _0'>far</span>, <span class='heard _0'>heard</span> <span class='steel _0'>steel</span> from a<span class='near _1'>near</span>,
<span class='hoof _0'>hoof</span>s <span class='ring _0'>ring</span> from a<span class='far _0'>far</span>, and <span class='heard _0'>heard</span> <span class='steel _0'>steel</span><span class='hoof _1'>hoof</span>s <span class='ring _1'>ring</span><span class='hoof _2'>hoof</span> <span class='ring _2'>ring</span><span class='steel _1'>steel</steel>.
--Am I awfully sunburnt?
Miss <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> unbloused her neck.
--No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with
the cherry laurel water?
Miss Douce halfstood to <span class='sea _0'>see</span> her skin askance in the barmirror
gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a
shell.
--And leave it to my hands, she said.
--Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce
--Those things only bring out a rash, replied, re<span class='sea _0'>sea</span>ted. I asked that <span class='old _0'>old</span>
fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a <span class='full _0'>full</span>drawn tea, grimaced and <span class='pray _0'>pray</span>ed:
--<span class='O _0'>O</span>, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!
--But <span class='wait _0'>wait</span> till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two
ears with little fingers.
--No, don't, she cried.
--I won't <span class='listen _0'>listen</span>, she cried.
But <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m?
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:
--For your what? says he.
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but
<span class='pray _0'>pray</span>ed again:
--Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous <span class='old _0'>old</span> wretch! That
<span class='night _0'>night</span> in the Antient Concert Rooms.
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.
--Here he was, miss Douce said, <span class='cock _0'>cock</span>ing her <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> head three quarters,
ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!
Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss
Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like
a snout in quest.
--<span class='O _0'>O</span>! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?
Miss Douce chimed in in <span class='deep _0'>deep</span> <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> laughter, shouting:
--And your <span class='other _0'>other</span> eye!
<span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>whose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always
think Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore's huguenot name.
By Bassi's blessed virgins <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m’s dark eyes went by. <span class='Bloo _1'>Blue</span>robed, white
under, <span class='come _0'>come</span> to me. God they <span class='believe _0'>believe</span> she is: or goddess. Those today. I
could not <span class='sea _0'>see</span>. That fellow spoke. A student. After with <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus' son. He
might be Mulligan. All <span class='come _0'>come</span>ly virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows
in: her white.
By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.
Of sin.
In a giggling peal young <span class='gold _0'>gold</span><span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> voices blended, Douce with
Kennedy your <span class='other _0'>other</span> eye. They threw young heads back, <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> giggle<span class='gold _0'>gold</span>,
to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your <span class='other _0'>other</span>, signals to <span class='each _0'>each</span> <span class='other _1'>other<span>,
high piercing <span class='note _0'>note</span>s.
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth <span class='dying _0'>die</span>d down.
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, <span class='Ben _0'>ben</span>ding over the teatray, ruffled again her nose
and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair
pinnacles of <span class='hair _0'>hair</span>, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of
her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking,
crying:
--<span class='O _0'>O</span> greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. With
his bit of beard!
Douce gave <span class='full _0'>full</span> vent to a splendid yell, a <span class='full _1'>full</span> yell of <span class='full _2'>full</span> woman,
delight, joy, indignation.
--Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.
Shrill, with <span class='deep _0'>deep</span> laughter, after, <span class='gold _0'>gold</span> after <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span>, they urged <span class='each _0'>each</span>
<span class='each _0'>each</span> to peal after peal, <span class='ring _0'>ring</span>ing in changes, <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span><span class='gold _0'>gold</span>, <span class='gold _1'>gold</span><span class='bronze _1'>bronze</span>,
shrill<span class='deep _0'>deep</span>, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I
knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All <span class='flush _0'>flush</span>ed (<span class='O _0'>O</span>!),
panting, sweating (<span class='O _0'>O</span>!), all breathless.
Married to <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m, to grea<span class='sea _0'>sea</span><span class='Bloo _1'>bloo</span>m.
--<span class='O _0'>O</span> saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping <span class='rose _0'>rose</span>. I wished
I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.
--<span class='O _0'>O</span>, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!
And <span class='flush _0'>flush</span>ed yet more (you horrid!), more <span class='gold _0'>gold</span>enly.
By Cantwell's offices roved Grea<span class='sea _0'>sea</span><span class='Bloo _0'>bloo</span>m, by Ceppi's virgins, <span class='bright _0'>bright</span>
of their oils. Nannetti's father <span class='horn _0'>haw</span>ked those things about, wheedling at
doors as I. Religion pays. Must <span class='sea _0'>see</span> him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not
yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. <span class='clock _0'>Clock</span>hands turning. On. Where
eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with
those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.
<span class='flush _0'>Flush</span>ed less, still less, <span class='gold _0'>gold</span>enly paled.
Into their bar strolled Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus. <span class='chips _0'>Chips</span>, picking <span class='chips _1'>chips</span> off one of his
rocky thumbnails. <span class='chips _0'>Chips</span>. He strolled.
--<span class='O _0'>O</span>, welcome back, miss Douce.
He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?
--Tip<span class='tup _0'>top</span>.
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.
--Gorgeous, she said. <span class='look _0'>Look</span> at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand
all day.
<span class='bronze _0'>Bronze</span> whiteness.
--That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus told her and pressed
her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.
Miss Douce of <span class='satin _0'>satin</span> douced her arm away.
--<span class='O _0'>O</span> go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.
He was.
--Well now I am, he mused. I <span class='look _0'>look</span>ed so simple in the cradle they christened
me simple Simon.
--You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made <span class='answer _0'>answer</span>. And what did the
doctor order today?
--Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble you
for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.
<span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>le.
--With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and
Cochrane's she turned herself. With grace she <span class='tap _0'>tap</span>ped a measure of <span class='gold _0'>gold</span>
whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus
brought pouch and <span class='pipe _0'>pipe</span>. Alacrity she served. He <span class='Bloo _0'>blew</span> through the flue two
husky fife<span class='note _0'>note</span>s.
--By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to <span class='sea _0'>see</span> the Mourne mountains. Must be
a great tonic in the air down there. But a <span class='long _0'>long</span> threatening <span class='come _0'>come</span>s at last,
they say. Yes. Yes.
Yes. He fingered shreds of <span class='hair _0'>hair</span>, her <span class='maid _0'>maid</span>en<span class='hair _1'>hair</span>, her mer<span class='maid _1'>maid</span>'s, into
the bowl. <span class='chips _0'>Chips</span>. Shreds. Musing. Mute.
None nought said nothing. Yes.
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:
--<span class='O _0'>O</span>, I<span class='dolor _0'>DOLOR</span>ES, QUEEN OF THE EASTERN SEAS!
--Was Mr <span class='lyd _0'>Lid</span>well in today?
In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m reached
Essex bridge. Yes, Mr <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m crossed bridge of Yessex. To <span class='Martha _0'>Martha</span> I must
<span class='writ _0'>writ</span>e. Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m. <span class='old _0'>Old</span> <span class='Bloo _1'>Bloo</span>m. <span class='Bloo _2'>Blue</span> <span class='Bloo _3'>bloo</span>m is
on the rye.
--He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.
Lenehan came forward.
--Was Mr Boylan <span class='look _0'>look</span>ing for me?
He asked. She <span class='answer _0'>answer</span>ed:
--Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?
She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy <span class='answer _0'>answer</span>ed, a second teacup poised,
her gaze upon a page:
--No. He was not.
Miss gaze of Kennedy, <span class='heard _0'>heard</span>, not <span class='sea _0'>see</span>n, read on. Lenehan round the
sandwichbell wound his round body round.
--<span class='peep _0'>Peep</span>! Who's in the corner?
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind
her stops. To read only the <span class='black _0'>black</span> ones: round <span class='O _0'>o</span> and crooked ess.
<span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>le <span class='Jing _1'>jaunt</span>y <span class='Jing _2'>jing</span>le.
Girl<span class='gold _0'>gold</span> she read and <span class='didnot _0'>did not</span> glance. Take no notice. She took no
notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:
--Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill
down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?
He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.
He sighed aside:
--Ah me! <span class='O _0'>O</span> my!
He greeted Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus and got a nod.
--Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.
--Who may he be? Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus asked.
Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?
--Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.
Dry.
Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus, famous father, laid by his dry filled <span class='pipe _0'>pipe</span>.
--I <span class='sea _0'>see</span>, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is keeping
very select company. Have you <span class='sea _0'>see</span>n him lately?
He had.
--I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In
<span class='moon _0'>Moon</span>ey's EN VILLE and in <span class='moon _1'>Moon</span>ey's SUR MER. He had received the rhino for
the labour of his muse.
He smiled at <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span>'s teabathed lips, at <span class='listen _0'>listen</span>ing lips and eyes:
--The ELITE of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh
MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy
of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the
O'Madden Burke.
After an interval Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus raised his grog and
--That must have been highly diverting, said he. I <span class='sea _0'>see</span>.
He <span class='sea _0'>see</span>. He drank. With <span class='far _0'>far</span>away mourning mountain eye. Set down
his glass.
He <span class='look _0'>look</span>ed towards the saloon door.
--I <span class='sea _0'>see</span> you have moved the piano.
--The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking
concert and I never <span class='heard _0'>heard</span> such an exquisite player.
--Is that a fact?
--Didn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,
poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.
--Is that a fact? Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus said.
He drank and strayed away.
--So <span class='sad _0'>sad</span> to <span class='look _0'>look</span> at his face, miss Douce condoled.
God's curse on bitch's bastard.
Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and
diningroom came <span class='bald _0'>bald</span> <span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span>, came bothered <span class='Pat _1'>Pat</span>, came <span class='Pat _2'>Pat</span>, <span class='wait _0'>wait</span>er of
Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.
With patience Lenehan <span class='wait _0'>wait</span>ed for Boylan with impatience, for
<span class='Jing _0'>jing</span>le<span class='Jing _1'>jaunt</span>y blazes boy.
Upholding the <span class='lyd _0'>lid</span> he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the
oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently
her hand), <span class='soft _0'>soft</span> pedalling, a triple of keys to <span class='sea _0'>see</span> the thicknesses of felt
advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was
in Wisdom Hely's wise <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not
happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means
something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable
girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m eyed on the door
a poster, a swaying mer<span class='maid _0'>maid</span> smoking mid nice <span class='wave _0'>wave</span>s. Smoke mer<span class='maid _1'>maid</span>s,
<span class='cool _0'>cool</span>est whiff of all. <span class='hair _0'>Hair</span> streaming: <span class='love _0'>love</span>lorn. For some man. For Raoul.
He eyed and saw a<span class='far _0'>far</span> on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a <span class='Jing _0'>jaunt</span>ing car. It
is. Again. Third time. <span class='coin _0'>Coin</span>cidence.
<span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>ling on supple rubbers it <span class='Jing _1'>jaunt</span>ed from the bridge to Ormond
quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. <span class='near _0'>Near</span> now. Out.
--Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.
--Aha ... I was forgetting ... Excuse ...
--And four.
At four she. Winsomely she on <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>himwhom smiled. <span class='Bloo _1'>Bloo</span> smi qui
go. Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.
For <span class='men _0'>men</span>.
In drowsy <span class='silent _0'>silence</span> <span class='gold _0'>gold</span> <span class='Ben _0'>ben</span>t on her page.
From the saloon a <span class='call _0'>call</span> came, <span class='long _0'>long</span> in <span class='dying _0'>dying</span>. That was a tuningfork the
tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A <span class='call _0'>call</span> again. That he now
poised that it now <span class='throb _0'>throb</span>bed. You hear? It <span class='throb _1'>throb</span>bed, <span class='pure _0'>pure</span>, <span class='pure _1'>pure</span>r, <span class='soft _0'>soft</span>ly and
<span class='soft _0'>soft</span>lier, its buzzing prongs. <span class='long _0'>Long</span>er in <span class='dying _0'>dying</span> <span class='call _0'>call</span>.
<span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span> paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and
popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, <span class='bald _0'>bald</span> and bothered, with Miss
Douce.
--THE <span class='bright _0'>BRIGHT</span> STARS FADE ....
A voiceless song sang from within, singing:
-- ... THE MORN IS BREAKING.
A duodene of bird<span class='note _0'>note</span>s chirruped <span class='bright _0'>bright</span> treble <span class='answer _0'>answer</span> under sensitive
hands. <span class='bright _0'>Bright</span>ly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsi<span class='chord _0'>chord</span>ing, <span class='call _0'>call</span>ed to
a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of <span class='love _0'>love</span>'s leavetaking,
life's, <span class='love _0'>love</span>'s morn.
--THE DEWDROPS PEARL ....
Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.
--But <span class='look _0'>look</span> this way, he said, <span class='rose _0'>rose</span> of <span class='Castile _0'>Castile</span>.
<span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>le <span class='Jing _1'>jaunt</span>ed by the curb and stopped.
She <span class='rose _0'>rose</span> and closed her reading, <span class='rose _1'>rose</span> of <span class='Castile _0'>Castile</span>: fretted, forlorn,
dreamily <span class='rose _0'>rose</span>.
--Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.
She <span class='answer _0'>answer</span>ed, slighting:
--Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.
Like lady, ladylike.
Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he
strode. Yes, <span class='gold _0'>gold</span> from a<span class='near _0'>near</span> by <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> from a<span class='far _0'>far</span>. Lenehan <span class='heard _0'>heard</span> and knew
and hailed him:
--<span class='sea _0'>See</span> the conquering hero <span class='come _0'>come</span>s.
Between the car and <span class='wind _0'>wind</span>ow, warily walking, went <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloom</span>,
unconquered hero. <span class='sea _0'>See</span> me he might. The <span class='sea _1'>sea</span>t he sat on: <span class='warm _0'>warm</span>. <span class='black _0'>Black</span> wary
hecat walked towards Richie <span class='gold _0'>Gould</span>ing's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.
--AND I FROM THEE ....
--I <span class='heard _0'>heard</span> you were round, said Blazes Boylan.
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She
smiled on him. But sister <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> outsmiled her, preening for him her richer
<span class='hair _0'>hair</span>, a bosom and a <span class='rose _0'>rose</span>.
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.
--What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for
me. Wire in yet?
Not yet. At four she. Who said four?
<span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office.
Avoid. <span class='gold _0'>Gould</span>ing a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car <span class='wait _0'>wait</span>ing.
<span class='wait _0'>Wait</span>.
Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,
Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there. <span class='sea _0'>See</span>,
not be <span class='sea _0'>see</span>n. I think I'll join you. <span class='come _0'>Come</span> on. Richie led on. <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m followed
bag. Dinner fit for a prince.
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her <span class='satin _0'>satin</span> arm,
her bust, that all but burst, so high.
--<span class='O _0'>O</span>! <span class='O _1'>O</span>! jerked Lenehan, gasping at <span class='each _0'>each</span> stretch. <span class='O _2'>O</span>!
But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.
--Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.
She<span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span>, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his
lips, <span class='look _0'>look</span>ed as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped
with her voice:
--Fine goods in small parcels.
That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.
--Here's fortune, Blazes said.
He pitched a broad <span class='coin _0'>coin</span> down. <span class='coin _1'>Coin</span> <span class='ring _0'>rang</span>.
--Hold on, said Lenehan, till I ...
--Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.
--Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.
--I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you
know. Fancy of a friend of mine.
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's
lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.
I<span class='dolor _0'>dolor</span>es. The eastern <span class='sea _0'>sea</span>s.
<span class='clock _0'>Clock</span> whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who
gave), bearing away teatray. <span class='clock _0'>Clock</span> <span class='clock _1'>clack</span>ed.
Miss Douce took Boylan's <span class='coin _0'>coin</span>, struck boldly the cashregister. It
clanged. <span class='clock _0'>Clock</span> <span class='clock _1'>clack</span>ed. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and
hummed and handed <span class='coin _0'>coin</span>s in change. <span class='look _0'>Look</span> to the west. A <span class='clock _0'>clack</span>. For me.
--What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?
O'<span class='clock _0'>clock</span>.
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming,
tugged Blazes Boylan's elbowsleeve.
--Let's hear the time, he said.
The bag of <span class='gold _0'>Gould</span>ing, Collis, Ward led <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m by rye<span class='Bloo _1'>bloo</span>m flowered
tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, <span class='bald _0'>bald</span> <span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span> attending, a table <span class='near _0'>near</span>
the door. Be <span class='near _0'>near</span>. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not <span class='come _0'>come</span>:
whet appetite. I couldn't <span class='do _0'>do</span>. <span class='wait _0'>Wait</span>, <span class='wait _1'>wait</span>. <span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span>, <span class='wait _2'>wait</span>er, <span class='wait _3'>wait</span>ed.
Sparkling <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> azure eyed Blazure's sky<span class='Bloo _0'>blue</span> bow and eyes.
--Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never <span class='heard _0'>heard</span>.
-- ... TO FLORA'S LIPS DID HIE.
High, a high <span class='note _0'>note</span> pealed in the treble clear.
<span class='bronze _0'>Bronze</span>douce communing with her <span class='rose _0'>rose</span> that sank and <span class='rose _1'>rose</span> sought
Blazes Boylan's flower and eyes.
--Please, please.
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.
--I COULD NOT LEAVE THEE ...
--Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.
--No, now, urged Lenehan. <span class='sonnez _0'>SONNEZ</span>LA<span class='cloche _0'>CLOCHE</span>! <span class='O _0'>O</span> do! There's no-one.
She <span class='look _0'>look</span>ed. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden <span class='Ben _0'>ben</span>t. Two
kindling faces watched her <span class='Ben _0'>ben</span>d.
Quavering the <span class='chord _0'>chord</span>s strayed from the air, found it again, <span class='lost _0'>lost</span> <span class='chord _1'>chord</span>,
and <span class='lost _0'>lost</span> and found it, faltering.
--Go on! Do! <span class='sonnez _0'>SONNEZ</span>!
<span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span>ding, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted
them still, <span class='Ben _0'>ben</span>ding, suspending, with wilful eyes.
--<span class='sonnez _0'>SONNEZ</span>!
Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter
smack<span class='warm _0'>warm</span> against her smackable a woman's <span class='warm _1'>warm</span>hosed thigh.
--LA <span class='cloche _0'>CLOCHE</span>! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't <span class='men _0'>men</span>?), but, lightward
gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.
--You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.
Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice
tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went
after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch
for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it
concerted, mirrored, <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> with sunnier <span class='bronze _1'>bronze</span>.
Yes, <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> from a<span class='near _0'>near</span>by.
-- ... SWEETHEART, GOODBYE!
--I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.
--<span class='wait _0'>Wait</span> a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.
Tom Rochford ...
--<span class='come _0'>Come</span> on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
Lenehan gulped to go.
--Got the <span class='horn _0'>horn</span> or what? he said. <span class='wait _0'>Wait</span>. I'm coming.
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the
threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.
--How do you <span class='do _0'>do</span>, Mr <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard?
--Eh? How <span class='do _0'>do</span>? How <span class='do _1'>do</span>? <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard's vague bass <span class='answer _0'>answer</span>ed, turning an
instant from Father <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob. Alf
Bergan will speak to the <span class='long _0'>long</span> fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in that Judas
Iscariot's ear this time.
Sighing Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an
eyelid.
--Hoho, we will, <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard yodled jollily. <span class='come _0'>Come</span> on, Simon. Give us a
ditty. We <span class='heard _0'>heard</span> the piano.
<span class='bald _0'>Bald</span> <span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span>, bothered <span class='wait _0'>wait</span>er, <span class='wait _1'>wait</span>ed for drink orders. Power for Richie.
And <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m? Let me <span class='sea _0'>see</span>. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now.
How <span class='warm _0'>warm</span> this <span class='black _0'>black</span> is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me
<span class='sea _0'>see</span>. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.
--What's that? Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus said. I was only vamping, man.
--<span class='come _0'>Come</span> on, <span class='come _1'>come</span> on, <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard <span class='call _0'>call</span>ed. Begone dull care. <span class='come _2'>Come</span>, Bob.
He ambled <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with
the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard on the stool.
His gouty paws plumped <span class='chord _0'>chord</span>s. Plumped, stopped abrupt.
<span class='bald _0'>Bald</span> <span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span> in the doorway met tealess <span class='gold _0'>gold</span> returning. Bothered, he
wanted Power and cider. <span class='bronze _0'>Bronze</span> by the <span class='wind _0'>wind</span>ow, watched, <span class='bronze _1'>bronze</span> from
a<span class='far _0'>far</span>.
<span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>le a tinkle <span class='Jing _1'>jaunt</span>ed.
<span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m <span class='heard _0'>heard</span> a <span class='Jing _0'>jing</span>, a little <span class='sound _0'>sound</span>. He's off. Light sob of breath <span class='Bloo _1'>Bloo</span>m
sighed on the <span class='silent _0'>silent</span> <span class='Bloo _0'>blue</span>hued flowers. <span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>ling. He's gone. <span class='Jing _1'>Jing</span>le. Hear.
--<span class='love _0'>Love</span> and War, <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span>, Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus said. God be with <span class='old _0'>old</span> times.
Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,
smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting
light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down
pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span>, over the bar
where <span class='bald _0'>bald</span> stood by sister <span class='gold _0'>gold</span>, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite
nonexquisite, slow <span class='cool _0'>cool</span> dim <span class='sea _0'>sea</span>green sliding depth of <span class='shadow _0'>shadow</span>, EAU DE NIL.
--Poor <span class='old _0'>old</span> Goodwin was the pianist that <span class='night _0'>night</span>, Father <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley reminded
them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the
Collard grand.
There was.
--A symposium all his own, Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus said. The devil wouldn't stop him.
He was a crotchety <span class='old _0'>old</span> fellow in the primary stage of drink.
--God, do you remember? <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> bulky <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard said, turning from the
punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.
They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding
garment.
--Our friend <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m turned in handy that <span class='night _0'>night</span>, Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus said. Where's
my <span class='pipe _0'>pipe</span>, by the way?
He wandered back to the bar to the <span class='lost _0'>lost</span> <span class='chord _0'>chord</span> <span class='pipe _0'>pipe</span>. <span class='bald _0'>Bald</span> <span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span> carried
two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley laughed again.
--I saved the situation, <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span>, I think.
--You did, averred <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard. I remember those tight trousers too. That
was a brilliant idea, Bob.
Father <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the
situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.
--I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in
the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who
was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the <span class='other _0'>other</span> business? Do you
remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in
Keogh's gave us the number. Remember?
<span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> remembered, his broad visage wondering.
--By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.
Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus wandered back, <span class='pipe _0'>pipe</span> in hand.
--Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He
wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of <span class='cock _0'>cock</span>ed hats
and boleros and trunkhose. What?
--<span class='ay _0'>Ay</span>, <span class='ay _1'>ay</span>, Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus nodded. Mrs Marion <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m has left off clothes of all
descriptions.
<span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>le <span class='Jing _1'>jaunt</span>ed down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.
Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, <span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span>.
Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de <span class='cock _0'>Kock</span>. 
Nice name he.
--What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion ...
--Tweedy.
--Yes. Is she alive?
--And kicking.
--She was a daughter of ...
--Daughter of the regiment.
--Yes, begad. I remember the <span class='old _0'>old</span> drummajor.
Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after
--Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?
Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.
--Buccinator muscle is ... What? ... Bit rusty ... <span class='O _0'>O</span>, she is ... My Irish Molly,
<span class='O _0'>O</span>.
He puffed a pungent plumy blast.
--From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.
They pined in depth of ocean <span class='shadow _0'>shadow</span>, <span class='gold _0'>gold</span> by the beerpull, <span class='bronze _0'>bronze</span> by
maraschino, thoughtful all two. <span class='Mina _0'>Mina</span> Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,

<span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span> served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before
he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while
Richie <span class='gold _0'>Gould</span>ing, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite
by bite of pie he ate <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m ate they ate.
<span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m with <span class='gold _0'>Gould</span>ing, married in <span class='silent _0'>silence</span>, ate. Dinners fit for princes.
By Bachelor's walk <span class='Jing _0'>jog</span><span class='Jing _1'>jaunt</span>y <span class='Jing _2'>jing</span>led Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun
in heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:
sprawled, <span class='warm _0'>warm</span><span class='sea _0'>sea</span>ted, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. <span class='horn _0'>Horn</span>. Have you

Over their voices <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard bassooned attack, booming over
bombarding <span class='chord _0'>chord</span>s:
--WHEN <span class='love _0'>LOVE</span> ABSORBS MY ARDENT SOUL ...
Roll of <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span>soul<span class='Ben _1'>ben</span>jamin rolled to the quivery <span class='love _0'>love</span>shivery roofpanes.
--War! War! cried Father <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley. You're the warrior.
--So I am, <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. <span class='love _0'>Love</span> or
money.
He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.
--Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus said
through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.
In bearded abundant laughter <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard shook upon the keyboard. He
would.
--Not to mention another membrane, Father <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley added. Half time,
<span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span>. AMOROSO MA NON TROPPO. Let me there.
Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of <span class='cool _0'>cool</span> stout. She
passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather.
They drank <span class='cool _0'>cool</span> stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going?

In liver gravy <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m mashed mashed potatoes. <span class='love _0'>Love</span> and War
someone is. <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard's famous. <span class='night _0'>Night</span> he ran round to us to borrow a
dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical
porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the
bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. <span class='O _0'>O</span> saints above,
I'm drenched! <span class='O _0'>O</span>, the women in the front row! <span class='O _1'>O</span>, I never laughed so many!
Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance
eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley. Musical.
Knows whatever <span class='note _0'>note</span> you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.
Miss Douce, engaging, <span class='lyd _0'>Lyd</span>ia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George
<span class='lyd _0'>Lid</span>well, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady's)
hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the <span class='old _0'>old</span> dingdong
again.
--Your friends are inside, Mr <span class='lyd _0'>Lid</span>well.
George <span class='lyd _0'>Lid</span>well, suave, solicited, held a <span class='lyd _1'>lyd</span>iahand.
<span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>le.

Piano again. <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together,

<span class='night _0'>Night</span> we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus,

Conductor's legs too, bagstrousers, <span class='Jing _0'>jig</span>gedy <span class='Jing _1'>jig</span>gedy. Do right to hide them.

Strongly.
--Go on, blast you! <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> <span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard growled. Get it out in bits.
--M'APPARI, Simon, Father <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley said.
Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his <span class='long _0'>long</span>

--Go on, Simon.
--Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, <span class='Ben _0'>Ben</span> ... Well ...
Mr <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus laid his <span class='pipe _0'>pipe</span> to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,
touched the obedient keys.
--No, Simon, Father <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.
The keys, obedient, <span class='rose _0'>rose</span> higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.
<span class='tup _0'>Up</span> stage strode Father <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley.
--Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get <span class='tup _0'>up</span>.

Most beautiful tenor air ever <span class='writ _0'>writ</span>ten, Richie said: SONNAMBULA. He
<span class='heard _0'>heard</span> Joe Maas sing that one <span class='night _0'>night</span>. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way.
Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.
Never forget it. Never.
Tenderly <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.
Backache he. <span class='bright _0'>Bright</span>'s <span class='bright _1'>bright</span> eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the
<span class='pipe _0'>pipe</span>r. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings
too: DOWN AMONG THE DEAD MEN. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the.
Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power.
Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking
matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and
drabs. And when he's wanted not a <span class='far _0'>far</span>thing. Screwed refusing to pay his
<span class='far _0'>far</span>e. Curious types.
Never would Richie forget that <span class='night _0'>night</span>. As <span class='long _0'>long</span> as he lived: never. In
the gods of the <span class='old _0'>old</span> Royal with little Peake. And when the first <span class='note _0'>note</span>.

Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.
<span class='believe _0'>Believe</span>s his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.
--Which air is that? asked Leopold <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m.
--ALL IS LOST NOW.
Richie <span class='cock _0'>cock</span>ed his lips apout. A low incipient <span class='note _0'>note</span> sweet banshee
murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he's
proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is <span class='lost _0'>lost</span>. Rich <span class='sound _0'>sound</span>. Two <span class='note _0'>note</span>s in one

sweet the <span class='answer _0'>answer</span>. How is that done? All <span class='lost _0'>lost</span> now. Mournful he whistled.
Fall, surrender, <span class='lost _0'>lost</span>.

Innocence in the <span class='moon _0'>moon</span>. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her

That's why. Woman. As easy stop the <span class='sea _0'>sea</span>. Yes: all is <span class='lost _0'>lost</span>.
--A beautiful air, said <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m <span class='lost _0'>lost</span> Leopold. I know it well.
Never in all his life had Richie <span class='gold _0'>Gould</span>ing.
He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise
child that knows her father, <span class='Ded _0'>Ded</span>alus said. Me?

Richie once. Jokes <span class='old _0'>old</span> stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye.
Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir.
Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.
Piano again. Sounds better than last time I <span class='heard _0'>heard</span>. Tuned probably.
Stopped again.
<span class='Doll _0'>Doll</span>ard and <span class='Cow _0'>Cow</span>ley still urged the lingering singer out with it.
--With it, Simon.
--It, Simon.
--Ladies and gentlemen, I am most <span class='deep _0'>deep</span>ly obliged by your kind
solicitations.
--It, Simon.
--I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour

The harping <span class='chord _0'>chord</span>s of prelude closed. A <span class='chord _1'>chord</span>, <span class='long _0'>long</span>drawn,
expectant, drew a voice away.
--WHEN FIRST I SAW THAT FORM ENDEARING ...
Richie turned.

-- ... SORROW FROM ME SEEMED TO DEPART.
Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves
in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyou<span class='call _0'>call</span>them
dulcimers touching their still ears with <span class='word _0'>word</span>s, still hearts of their <span class='each _0'>each</span> his

the elastic band of his packet. <span class='love _0'>Love</span>'s <span class='old _0'>old</span> sweet <span class='sonnez _0'>SONNEZ</span> LA <span class='gold _0'>gold</span>. <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m

round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.
--FULL OF HOPE AND ALL DELIGHTED ...
Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at
his feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. <span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>le all delighted. He
can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What
perfume does your wife? I want to know. <span class='Jing _0'>Jing</span>. Stop. Knock. Last <span class='look _0'>look</span> at
mirror always before she <span class='answer _0'>answer</span>s the door. The hall. There? How do you?
I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her
satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.
Alas the voice <span class='rose _0'>rose</span>, sighing, changed: loud, <span class='full _0'>full</span>, shining, proud.
--BUT ALAS, 'TWAS IDLE DREAMING ...
Glorious tone he has still. Cork air <span class='soft _0'>soft</span>er also their brogue. Silly man!
Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong <span class='word _0'>word</span>s. Wore out his
wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn't
break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too. Drink.
Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup: stock,
sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.
Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, <span class='full _0'>full</span> it <span class='throb _0'>throb</span>bed. That's the chat.
Ha, give! Take! <span class='throb _0'>Throb</span>, a <span class='throb _1'>throb</span>, a pulsing proud erect.

The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to
Richie Poldy <span class='lyd _0'>Lyd</span>ia <span class='lyd _1'>Lid</span>well also sang to <span class='Pat _0'>Pat</span> open mouth ear <span class='wait _0'>wait</span>ing to

That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the <span class='silent _0'>silence</span> after

Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat.

Numbers it is. All music when you <span class='come _0'>come</span> to think. Two multiplied by

<span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He <span class='heard _0'>heard</span>
more faintly that that they <span class='heard _0'>heard</span>, <span class='each _0'>each</span> for herself a<span class='lone _0'>lone</span>, then <span class='each _1'>each</span> for

Why do they hide their ears with <span class='sea _0'>sea</span>weed <span class='hair _0'>hair</span>? And Turks the mouth,
why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave. No

Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the
resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law
of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian, gipsyeyed.
Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle. Hissss. Now.

All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his

No son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?

Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The <span class='love _0'>love</span>ly name you.
Low sank the music, air and <span class='word _0'>word</span>s. Then hastened. The false priest

meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand
animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.
Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?
Will? You? I. Want. You. To.
With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic

On the smooth jutting beerpull laid <span class='lyd _0'>Lyd</span>ia hand, lightly, plumply,

passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly,

Breathe a <span class='pray _0'>pray</span>er, drop a tear, good <span class='men _0'>men</span>, good people. He was the croppy

Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy <span class='Bloo _0'>Bloo</span>m in the Ormond
